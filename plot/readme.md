`chl_visual.pdf`, `mld_visual.pdf`, `ncp/npp_visual.pdf`, and `par_visual.pdf` explores the relationship between Chromium concentrations and CHL, MLD, NCP/NPP, and PAR respectively. `reproduce.ipynb` attempts to reproduce Figure 4 in the paper "Biological control of chromium redox and stable isotope composition in the surface ocean" by Janssen et al. (2020). `cartopy.ipynb` is the codes to visualize our dataset for NCP modeling. `ncp_map.png` visualizes the NCP distribution on a map, while `ncp_hist.png` is the histogram of the distributions of NCP and latitudes in our datasets.
