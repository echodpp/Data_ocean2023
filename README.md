# Understanding the Ocean Biological Carbon Pump with Big Data

This is the repository for the 2023 Data+/Climate+ project "Understanding the ocean biological carbon pump with big data." Our project focuses on net community production (NCP), a critical biological process controlling the carbon dioxide fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean. Our goal is to estimate global NCP using machine learning algorithms trained with satellite data and cruise records. To check our raw datasets, please go to the `original_data` folder. To check our processed data, please visit the `processed_data` folder. For our codes for plotting and visualization, please check the `plot` folder. Finally, the `model` folder stores the codes of our models to estimate the NCP. See the readme in each child folder for more details. Note that some codes might not work because the file location changes or we did not put certain auxiliary files on the repository.
